Tip: disable automatic saving of workspace in RStudio 

]

???

- when you start programming with R, you tend to predominantly use the console
- at the end: save result as workspace -> discouraged
- when you load an .RData file after 3 months, do you remember every single step
you executed to get to this workspace?
- better: Save your commands in an R script (.R file) or R Markdown 
document (.Rmd) instead of saving the results of your interactive 
analysis as workspace (.Rdata)
- these files may be a bit messy (prototyping) 
- don't need to be perfectly polished


<!-- - working with files is easier using an IDE like RStudio in comparison with  -->
<!--  the inbuilt RGui -->

#### &#x2705; Restart R often

- Restart R in RStudio: _Session &rarr; Restart R_

- Restart R from the shell: **Ctrl**+**D** or `q()` to quit current session, 
then restart R
- Restart development where you left off, i.e., re-run all code above cursor position:
  - in an R script: **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**B**
  - in an R Markdown file: **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**P**

- e.g. global options, unusual order of packages in search path, or other objects in workspace

class: middle

#### &#x2705; Avoid using `rm(list = ls())`

Unlike restarting R, the command `rm(list = ls())` .red[**does not**] 
create a new R session.

- &#x2757; It only removes all user-created objects from the environment.
- &#x2757; Previously loaded packages are still in the search path.
- &#x2757; Modifications to global options are still there.

`rm(list = ls())` makes a script **vulnerable to hidden dependencies** 
on commands that were ran in the R session before executing `rm(list = ls())`.

???

- popular modification: `options(scipen = 999)` to get rid of scientific notation of numbers
- scipen: integer. A penalty to be applied when deciding to print numeric values in fixed or exponential notation.

```{r dont, eval=FALSE}
library(Hmisc)
library(dplyr)
summarize(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, mean)

rm(list = ls())

library(Hmisc)
summarize(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, mean)

hist(rnorm(1000, 1e10)) # draw random sample of 1000 values from a normal distribution with a mean = 10 billion

options(scipen = 999)
hist(rnorm(1000, 1e10))

rm(list = ls())

&#x1F914; _"What about time-consuming scripts that take hours or maybe even 
days? It is impracticable to re-run these scripts every time we need the 
results."_

???

Rerunning an end-to-end analysis is sometimes impractical, because parts of the 
computations are very time-consuming.

It is recommended to split this computationally heavy part of your code into 
a new script. At the end of this script, you save the output as `.rds` file:

`saveRDS(data_prep, "results/data_preprocessed.rds"))`

The working directory corresponds to the top-level folder of the project

subfolders of the project's top-level folder. In the code, the files should 
be referenced with relative paths.

- hidden folder `.Rproj.user`: project-specific temporary files (_better not touch it_)
- open .Rproj: starts R, working directory to top-level folder 
of project, restore previously opened files (pick up where you left off)
- switch to another .Rproj: new R session, working directory to top-level folder 
of project, restore previously opened files (pick up where you left off)
- simultaneously work on 2 projects where each project has its own R session

- it's convenient to put setwd() at the top of each script
- if we move our folders containing raw data or R scripts we need to change the 
file path at every occurrence of setwd() which can be tedious 
- doesn't even work for the same author when switching to a new computer or OS
- example of bad practice: not self-contained, not portable 
- file paths will not work for anyone besides the author
- chance that objects from one project will leak into the set of objects 
from another project in case a new R session is not started

- the target hist depends on the create_plot() function and the target report 
in turn depends on hist
- these targets have become outdated
since drake automatically created this provenance graph of dependencies, 
it knows that the other three targets raw_data, data and fit are not affected by 
the change in create_plot and thus, their code does not need to be rerun, 
drake takes the values from the cache

- avoid special characters such as German Umlaute, space character and capitalization
- stick to lower-case letters, numbers, hyphen and underscore characters
- 3 principles
- 1: machine readable: structure names in a way that let's you refind them using 
regular expressions
- elements of a semantic unit are connected with hyphens, e.g. first sematic unit 
"date": year, month and date are connected by hyphen
- different semantic units are separated by underscore, e.g. date, 
assay, plasmid type, well number
- use str_split_fixed to recover meta-data from file names
- 2: human readable: instead of 01.R, 02.R etc, put some information in the file name 
on what the script does -> 01_read-data.R, 02-filter-data.R, etc.
- again semantic units: prefix (order of execution), then what the file is about
- plays well with default ordering: chronological (data that have time-stamps) 
or logical (order of execution in a project workflow)
- longtime payoff for little short-term pain

## Package library management

- R packages are stored in one or more directories on your computer (`.libPaths()`)
  + **user library**: packages that _you_ install are (usually) contained in `.libPaths()[1]`
  + **system library**: default packages are (usually) contained in `.libPaths()[2]`

--

- RStudio Packages tab provides a convenient interface for installing and 
updating packages

???

- why CRAN: most effective way to make a package available for public use
- Linux: automatically have tools installed to install "bundled" version of a package (.tar.gz)

--

- Use `install.packages(<pkgname>)` to install or update packages via the console
  + installs **_binary_** version from CRAN (no additional tools required)
  + binary: single, OS-specific file (.zip for Windows, .tgz for macOS)


--

Sometimes, you need the latest development version hosted on GitHub, BitBucket, etc.

- Use `remotes::install_github(<username>/<pckname>)` to install or packages via the console 
  + installs **_source_** version 
  + source: OS-independent directory with a specific structure
  + example: `remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")`
  + additional tools for compilation necessary, e.g. Rtools for Windows
  
---

## Package library management

- many packages are continuously under development even after CRAN release
- package maintainers generally pay attention to backwards compatibility, but there is no guarantee that there will not be changes that introduce existing code to fail

--

Scenarios where we need another way of package management:

- &#x2757; _We want to ship the final project code to our customers. The code does not only have to work now, but also in 3 months, 6 months, 1 year from now on._
- &#x2757; _We do not want to keep track of code-breaking package updates._
- &#x2757; _For other projects, we must be able to update packages, in order to make use of new useful features._ 

???

- we have a finished, stable project
- we don't want to make changes to your code every time there is a code-breaking  change in one of the packages
- we still want to be able to update our packages for other projects so that we can work with the latest features of the packages
- we want your project code to be reproducible, portable and isolated from other projects

For example, tools like renv (and its predecessor packrat) automate the process of managing project-specific libraries. This can be important for making data products reproducible, portable, and isolated from one another. A package developer might prepend the library search path with a temporary library, containing a set of packages at specific versions, in order to explore issues with backwards and forwards compatibility, without affecting other day-to-day work

## Package library management with renv

`renv`: **dependency manager** that helps to set up and maintain **project-local R libraries**

.pull-left70[

- **isolated**: each project has its own library of packages
  + &xrarr; updating packages globally or in another package will not affect current project
- **portable**: version numbers of all "active" packages are tracked in a "lock file" 
  + &xrarr; facilitates collaboration
- **reproducible**: enables saving a "snapshot", i.e., a state of the project library that you know is working 
  + &xrarr; safety net in case a package update causes problems 
- **disk-space-efficient**: packages are installed into a global cache; different projects that use the same version of a package will pull a "shared" package installation from the global cache 
  + &xrarr; also reduces installation time when a package has already been installed by another project that is managed with renv

## Error handling

How to find the source of an error in your R code?

Recommended strategy:

1. **Restart R.** &rarr; Make sure the error _always_ occurs.

???

1. rule out errors due to hidden dependencies
1. it is very likely that somebody else had the error before you and posted this error and meanwhile there is a working solution
1. short intro
1. Use internet communities (Twitter, SO, RStudio Community, ...). 
Includes creating a minimal reproducible example (code snippet)
  - reproducible: self-contained, everything needed to reproduce the error message is included
  - minimal: remove code that is irrelevant for the error message. helps isolating the cause of the error
  
- automated testing

--

1. **Google the error message.** &rarr; It is likely that there is already an existing solution on Stack Overflow, RStudio Community, Twitter or other fora.

--

1. **Debug.**

--

1. **Ask for help.** &rarr; Prepare a [reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) and ask the internet. 

---

## Debugging

```{r debug-1}
f <- function(a) g(a)
g <- function(b) h(b)
h <- function(c) i(c)
i <- function(d) {
  if (!is.numeric(d)) {
    stop("`d` must be numeric", call. = FALSE)
  }
  d + 10
}
```

&#x1F914; What is the result of this code when we run `f("10")`?

```{r debug-2, error=TRUE}
f("10")
```

---

## Interactive debug mode

???

- show **traceback** aka the call stack: sequence of functions called that led to the error
- rerun with Debug: set a break point immediately before the error is thrown
  - code execution is paused
  - allows to inspect environment of a function

--

1. set break point (click on gray space left to line number or **⇧Shift**+**F9**)

???

- stop executing code exactly at the line of the break point

--

2. console debugging commands (`n,s,f,c,Q`)

???

- n: execute next step
- s: step into function
- f: finish execution of current loop/function
- c: stop debugging & continue code execution until next break point
- Q: leave interactive debugging & continue code execution

--

3. `browser()`

???

- similar to first approach, but source code is changed

--

4. `debug()`, `debugOnce()`

???

- just for completeness: adds break point at the beginning of a function
- debugOnce: one-shot break point, i.e., the function will enter the debugger the very next time it runs, but not after that

--

5. `undebug()`

--

6. RStudio: _Debug_ &xrarr; _On Error_ &xrarr; _Break in Code_

???

- enters interactive debugging at the line where the error occurs

--

7. `debugSource()`

???

- advantage of browser(): recursive debugging of scripts

--

8. `options(error = recover)`

???

- interactive prompt that displays the traceback

--

9. `options(warn = 2)`

???

- convert warning to error

???
