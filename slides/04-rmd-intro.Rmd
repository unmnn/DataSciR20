```{r analysis, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
age_threshold <- 45
census <- read_rds(here::here("datasets", "german_census_2011_clean.rds")) 
(young <- census %>%
  filter(avg_age <= age_threshold))
```

We have data about `r nrow(census)` districts, 
`r nrow(census) - nrow(young)` of them with an 
average age above `r age_threshold` years. The 
distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
young %>% 
  ggplot(aes(avg_age)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black")
```
